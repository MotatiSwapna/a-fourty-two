 The Indian rupee is the currency of India. 
 The rupee’s currency code is INR, and its symbol is ₹. 
 This symbol has origins in the Indian flag, and incorporates the flag’s horizontal stripes.
 Foreigners are not generally allowed to take INR in or out of India, so currency exchange must occur within the country.
 American paper currency come in seven denominations: $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100.
 The United States no longer issues bills in larger denominations, such as $500, $1,000, $5,000, and $10,000 bills.
 But they are still legal tender and may still be in circulation.
 All U.S. currency issued since 1861 is valid and redeemable at its full face value.
